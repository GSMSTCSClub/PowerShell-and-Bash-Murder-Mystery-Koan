# Bash/PowerShell Murder Mystery Koan

This is a series of "koans" with a murdery mystery scenario. writeups and instructions found in [this Google Slides presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ESofmSddEVNPGzGG_DvBIdFouVz2BqKmv6VcpH7n-Uo/edit?usp=sharing)
A koan is like a series of programming test cases to learn a language.

> Where's the source code?

yeah... i cant find the original python script I used to create this before I obfuscated it with pyarmor. maybe someone intelligent can decompile it in the near future, or maybe I'll find it laying around in my discord messages somewhere.

HOWEVER. I do have [an incomplete, unobfuscated version](https://github.com/anishgoyal1108/PowerShell-and-Bash-Murder-Mystery-Koan/blob/main/main-incomplete.py) of the script, but its only like 5% of the actual thing.
