# Bash/PowerShell Murder Mystery Koan

This is a series of "koans" with a murdery mystery scenario. writeups and instructions found in [this Google Slides presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ESofmSddEVNPGzGG_DvBIdFouVz2BqKmv6VcpH7n-Uo/edit?usp=sharing)

A koan is a series of programming test cases to learn a coding language. this is the first time ive seen it used in a cybersecurity context, which actually makes me the first person on earth to do something! (crazy right)

> Where's the source code?

yeah... i cant find the original python script I used to create this before I obfuscated it with pyarmor. maybe someone intelligent can decompile it in the near future, or maybe I'll find it laying around in my discord messages somewhere.

Future anish here: I found it!! [Here you go!!](https://github.com/anishgoyal1108/PowerShell-and-Bash-Murder-Mystery-Koan/blob/main/main.py)

## playing on local
git clone the repo. u need bash and powershell

## playing on remote
you need to fork [the repl](https://replit.com/@anish1108/PowerShell-and-Bash-Murder-Mystery?v=1) on Replit and run it. note that the pwsh binary on repl is horribly outdated and slow, since it's not actually "supported" by the repl team.
