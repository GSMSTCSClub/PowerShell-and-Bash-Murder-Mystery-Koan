We need to look through for more information on the suspect.
Lucky for us, the FBI has a database we can use! Unfortunately, it's filled with a bunch of gibberish.
We know there's a file in the database containing the suspect's physical appearance, but searching for 
it manually would take too long... it's up to you to figure it out.

Using Bash, what is the contents of the file?
