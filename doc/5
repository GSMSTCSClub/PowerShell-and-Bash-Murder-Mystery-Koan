Records Cleanup:

Oh no! The murderer deleted our investigation records! Without it, we can't work on the case.
We need your help. Please do the following:
1. Change the directory name back to "FBI Records"
2. They zip bombed our folder. You need to delete all the junk folders.
3. We need to establish new records for this case ASAP! Create files and folders in "FBI Records" as follows:
- Suspects
  - names.txt
- Evidence
  - locations.txt
  - witnesses.txt
  - murder_weapons.txt

Although this problem only checks whether the appropriate folders/files exist and are properly named, you are still expected to create a script that achieves the specified file structure. Don't cheat by doing it manually because we will check your script!

NOTE: The contents of the evidence files is left intentionally ambiguous. You are NOT required to fill them with data.
