Oh no! The murderer deleted our investigation records! We need your help. Please do the following:
1. Change the directory name back to "FBI Records"
2. They zip bombed our folder. You need to delete all the junk folders.
3. We need to establish new records for this case ASAP! Create files and folders in "FBI Records" as follows:

FBI Records
├── Evidence
│   ├── locations.txt
│   ├── murder_weapons.txt
│   └── witnesses.txt
└── Suspects
    └── names.txt

This problem only checks whether the appropriate folders/files exist and are properly named, but you are still
expected to run a script that automatically creates the specified file structure. You must use scripting tools
for this; don't cheat by creating the files and directories manually!

NOTE: The contents of the evidence files are left intentionally ambiguous. You are NOT required to fill them with data.
